# A list of all features relevant for defining a harmony

*An attempt of reuniting various encodings of harmonic analyses*

## Concrete features (Note level)

* Extent, segment, area of validity
  * beginning (point or region)
  * ending (point or region)
  * [vertical segmentation (which staves form the harmony)]
* Which notes are considered as part of the harmony (minimum: list of pitches, medium: ordered list, maximum: list of note IDs)
  * chord tones
  * non-chord tones considered as belonging to the harmony (e.g. a fourth suspension)
